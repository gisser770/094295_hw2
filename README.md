Improving performance just by Data
We try to improve ResNet50 performance just by data manipulation as spliting into train and validation set, cleaning and coreccting the labels, normalization and augmentation.
In this repo is the environment.yml file, the notebook that we use and the report describe all our work.
The data and the model are to big for uploading.
