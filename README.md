Improving performance just by Data
We try to improve ResNet50 performance just by data manipulation as spliting into train and validation set, cleaning and coreccting the labels, normalization and augmentation.
In this repo is our data after cleaning and augmentation, the trained model and environment.yml file. 
In adiition here is the notebook that we use ans the report describe all our work.
